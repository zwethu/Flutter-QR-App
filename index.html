        <p>As QR Helper does not collect any personal information, we do not use any information for analytics,

        <p><strong>4. Data Handling</strong></p>
        <p><strong>QR Code Generation</strong>: The app allows you to generate QR codes from various string inputs, such

            or third party.</p>
        <p><strong>QR Code Scanning</strong>: The app uses your device's camera to scan QR codes and display the
            resulting string. This data is processed locally and is not shared with any server or third party.</p>
        <p><strong>Copy to Clipboard</strong>: Users have the option to copy the scanned string to their device's
            clipboard. This action is performed locally on your device.</p>

            please be aware that no method of transmitting data over the internet or storing data electronically can be
            guaranteed to be completely secure.</p>
